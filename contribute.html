      <h1>Why should we eliminate single use plastics?</h1>
      <br><b style="color:darkcyan">By 2050, it is predicted that there will be 12 billion tonnes
        of plastic waste in the natural environment</b>
      <p>Plastic pollution is jeopardizing human health and harming marine animals like whales and sea turtles at alarming rates. This problem began in the boardrooms of the top multinational companies when they decided to dump products packaged in single-use,
        non-recyclable plastic in places where there is no infrastructure to manage them. We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis. Over 90% of plastics have not been recycled. Countries in Southeast Asia are used as dumping ground through the
        global waste trade. We have to hold brands accountable and demand alternatives to cheap throwaway plastic packaging. The great news is, more than 3 million people around the world have joined Greenpeace to urge companies to stop polluting
        our planet with throwaway plastic. And it’s working. Because of mounting pressure from people like you, corporations are finally starting to admit that they are part of the problem, and they are talking about solutions. But we don’t need more
        talking—we need concrete, urgent action to stop plastic pollution at the source!</p>

        <h1>How can you play your part?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Single-use plastics, such as plates and cutlery made from this material, make our lives easier, but seriously harm the planet. These types of products have viable alternatives and there is an urgent need to chose these.</p>

        <p>If you have no choice but to buy a plastic bottle or a plastic container at the supermarket, reuse it instead of throwing it away. A bottle can be filled up as many times as you like and containers can be used to store other food.</p>

        <p>If, in addition to reducing your consumption of plastic, you manage to get your family, friends and co-workers to do the same by setting an example, the impact of your actions for the good of the planet will increase exponentially.</p>
        <p>The best day to plant a tree was 10 years ago, the second best day is now. Make your contribution by getting reusable cups.</p>
